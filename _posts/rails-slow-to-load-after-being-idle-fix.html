<div>Are you sick of your passenger-hosted rails app taking foreeeever to reload after you've been idle for a while? &nbsp;Put the following line in your global apache conf ( or your passenger.conf if you have one)</div>
<p />
<div>PassengerPoolIdleTime 0</div>
<p />
<div>This will stop passenger from unloading your process, so only the first one will go through the horrendous start up time. &nbsp;The default is 5 minutes of activity.</div>
<p />
<div>i cheated and looked at the documentation:</div>
<p />
