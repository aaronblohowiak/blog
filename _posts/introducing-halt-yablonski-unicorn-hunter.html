I have been developing the concept for a game about a gruff hero that is out to clean the streets of drug-dealing unicorns for a couple months now.  I've decided to open up my progress to keep my fans, friends and peers up-to-date on my progress.   So far, I've mainly been making decisions and sourcing talent, software and infrastructure.  The game's art will primarily be the work of a very talented friend of mine.  He has a great background, having worked on various movies and games, and is a real pleasure to work with, I hope he has as much fun as I do!

We have some initial assets imported into Unity and I've started coding the controls.

Additionally, I've started playing around with weapons:

Don't worry, mom, I will keep a fire extinguisher nearby. ;)

I've also been starting with level design and lighting:

<br /><b>Halt attacks Unicorns on the iPhone.</b><br />

My plan is to apply to speak at GDC2010, submit the game to IGF and remain open and transparent about developing the game.   Should be a fun ride!
