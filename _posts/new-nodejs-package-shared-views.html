So, you render a page and give it to the browser.  Then, you want to update parts of it as a result of changing data model.<p />Do you:<br /><ol><li>Have your jQuery update just the relevant divs, coupling your ui update code to your template layout?</li> <li>Re-write your views again in a js-friendly template language, duplicating effort and leading to subtle incompatibilities?</li><li>Have the server return html snippets, leading to issues down the road when you want to update multiple parts of the page as a result of the request?</li> <li>Just render the same template client-side, because you&#39;re using the new <a href="https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/shared-views">shared-views</a> package?</li></ol><div>If you want to use the sample templates on the client and the server, my new shared-views package ( <a href="https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/shared-views">https://github.com/aaronblohowiak/shared-views</a> ) will help you to build out the infrastructure that lets you do just that.  It isn&#39;t quite &quot;batteries-included&quot; -- you&#39;ll have to bring your own template language -- but I have written a simple example that shows it in use with haml-js.</div> <p /><div>This is one step closer to being able to render a page for delivery to the user and then let the user&#39;s browser just talk JSON with the server from there on out, updating the page with the same templates that were used in the initial page rendering.</div> <p /><div>Let me know if you have any questions - <a href="mailto:aaron.blohowiak@gmail.com">aaron.blohowiak@gmail.com</a></div>
