Lighting is hard.  Really hard. It can drastically change the look and feel of a game, a movie or your family portrait ;)

With Halt Yablonski: Unicorn Hunter, we want to have a dark feel, so the player understands the seriousness of the situation and becomes immersed in the dark reality that Halt faces on his quest to clean up the streets.

Here are some experiments:

As you can see, each variation gives us a slightly different feel.  The first is brighter overall, but we lose that stark high-contrast effect.  The second has bright highlights and dark low-lights, but feels very unnatural.  The last is somewhere in between, but the details of our hero are kind of lost.  There's definitely a lot more work to be done until we get it right! 

Feel free to drop me a line and let me know what you think!
