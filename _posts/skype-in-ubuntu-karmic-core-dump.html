If you are running ubuntu karmic and you `sudo aptitude upgrade`, and find you cannot start skype after reboot, then you may need to remove your existing install, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu">set up the <a href="http://www.medibuntu.com">www.medibuntu.com</a> repository</a> and then aptitude install skype-static-oss. Then, things should work again. 

Hopefully, the issue with the main distribution of skype will be resolved shortly.
