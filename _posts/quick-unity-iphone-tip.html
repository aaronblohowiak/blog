Scenario: You load up Unity iPhone and suddenly all of your draw calls look like they've doubled.  Crap.  The game is running really slow when you build it out to your phone and you have no idea what's going on. Suddenly, you remember that when last you were editing the scene, you were experimenting with camera positioning. D'Oh! You forgot to disable the copy of your main camera that you were using to explore new angles.  Whoops!  Disabling the second camera brings the world back to order. Whew! Another nightmare dissipated. <p />WARNING: do not try this at home, cardiac arrest or other deadly effects of panic may ensue. <p /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
