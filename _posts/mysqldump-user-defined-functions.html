If you are doing a mysqldump and you seem to be missing your UDF or multiple UDFs, then you ran into the same issue that i did.  For some reason, mysqldump does not include user defined functions in the dump.  In order to enable this, you have to include the <code>--routines</code> command line option.  Ugh.
