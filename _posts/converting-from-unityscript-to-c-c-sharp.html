Here's a situation most Unity3d developers run into: you have scripts in both C# and unity JavaScript, and you can't get them to work together even after you figure out the bizarre compilation order because you want bi-directional communication.  What to do?  Unfortunately, it seems as though the only thing you <strong>can</strong> do is to convert the UnityScript (JavaScript) to C#. Unfortunately, there is no completely automated way to do this.

Running the following search/replace in vim (what else?) in the following order gets you about 85% of the way there:
<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>%s/var \(.*\) : \(.*\) = \(.*\);/\2 \1 = \3;/g</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>%s/var \(.*\) : \(.*\);/\2 \1;/g</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>%s/function \(.*\)() : \(.*\)/public \2 \1()/g</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>%s/function \(.*\)/public void \1</pre></div>
</div>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>%s/boolean/bool</pre></div>
</div>

Other things that the above find/replaces won't catch are: foreach/for(a in b) dynamicly typed variables, variables whos types are implicit.. ie: var a = SomeFunction();, and it won't currently ensure that you have an 'f' following your floats -- 2.0f instead of 2.0.

As I <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/viewtopic.php?t=31226">mentioned</a> at the Unity3d forums:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"><em>more of a PITA is getting around c#'s inability to set variables on member properties ( ie: foo.color.a becomes tmpclr = foo.color; tmpclr.a= 0.2f; foo.color = tmpclr); I decided to create class-specific private member variables to avoid dynamic variable allocation (so we dont have as much garbage to collect.) </em></blockquote>
Finally, the last thing to worry about is how Unity3d implements coroutines in C#.. but I'll save that for another blog post.
