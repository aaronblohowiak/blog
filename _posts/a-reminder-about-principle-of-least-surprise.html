<p>In the office building of a client the bathrooms are single occupancy and each has a lock. &nbsp;That's not surprising. &nbsp;When you enter the bathroom and push in the button on the handle to lock the door, the door is locked. &nbsp;Still sane. &nbsp;However, whenever the door closes, it unlocks! &nbsp;So, if you enter the bathroom and lock the door behind you, it will unlock itself when it finishes closing.</p>
<p>The only way to have a locked door is to wait until the door is fully closed before pushing in the button. &nbsp;The only affordance that the door has unlocked is a barely-audible "click", and there is nothing special about this door or locking mechanism that will tell you it is going to unlock automatically -- it looks exactly like thousands of other doors with push-button locks.</p>
<p>The defense of this design is that you don't want people to be locked out of the bathroom, and this design prevents that from happening. &nbsp;However, which is worse: &nbsp;<strong>unlocking the bathroom </strong>while someone is inside and thinks it is locked, or risking the possibility that someone could lock themselves out of the bathroom?</p>
<p>If you chose "someone locking themselves out of the bathroom", then you should not be in charge of designing anything, ever.</p>
