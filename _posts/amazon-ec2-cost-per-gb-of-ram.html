<p>Working on a project for a client, I wanted to know what the most $-efficient way to keep stuff in ram on EC2-east. These boxes will only have traffic within the AZ, so there were no bandwidth costs. &nbsp;I compared On-Demand prices with Reserved prices (assuming 1 year commitment for reserved.)</p>
<p />
<div>For High-Memory instances:</div>
<div>&nbsp; On-Demand:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; about $21 per GB per month</div>
<p />
<div>&nbsp; Reserved (1yr commitment):</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; about &nbsp;$14 per GB per month</div>
<p />
<div>non-high-mem instances are about 50% more expensive when looking at the cost as $ per GB.</div>
