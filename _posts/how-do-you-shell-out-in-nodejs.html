If you want to shell out in NodeJS, (equivelent to Open3 or popen3), just use the <a href="http://nodejs.org/api.html#child_process-spawn-82" target="_blank">child_process.spawn.</a> This is the great asynch streaming way to have stdin, stdout and stderr all hooked up for you.Â  If you want to fire off something in the background and get a callback when it is, done, you just use <a href="http://nodejs.org/api.html#child_process-exec-87" target="_blank">child_process.exec</a><p />This is also like a system() or using backticks in languages that support such things...
