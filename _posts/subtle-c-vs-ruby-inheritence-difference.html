This subtle differences in ruby and C#'s inheritence semantics bit me in the ass.<p />In Ruby:<br /><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>class A
  def foo
    bar
  end
  def bar
    &quot;in a&quot;
  end
end

class B &lt; A
  def bar
    &quot;in b&quot;
  end
end</pre></div>
</div>
Calling "B.new.foo" will output "in b".  I assumed this is how method overriding worked in C#, but that was a mistake. The same example in C# would output "in a", because the `bar` referenced in A is not a message (like it is in ruby,) the compiler just sticks in the reference to the locally defined function.Â   An hour, a fistful of hair, and a call to a good friend (thanks AJ) later, I came to realize that in order to get the same kind of behavior, you have to use the "virtual" and "override" keywords in your classes' method signatures.<p />This is a great article that explains it all: <a href="http://www.prestwood.com/ASPSuite/kb/document_view.asp?qid=101472" target="_blank">C# Overriding (virtual, override)</a><p /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
